    <p>
        Builds can be submit using the form on the <a href="submit">Submit page</a> or via <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io/issues" target="_blank">Github Issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io/pulls" target="_blank">Github Pull Request</a>.
        Before deciding what way you want to use check out the <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>.<br>
        If you consider using a Pull Request, check out the <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io/blob/master/build/_example.html" target="_blank">build file example</a>.
        Pull Requests are the fastest way to get your build on the site, but they have to be done properly.
        Keep in mind, that Issues or Pull Requests will require you to have a <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">Github account</a>.<br>
        If you think you are not capable of doing a Pull Request with your build data as JSON file, no problem.
        Simply submit an <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io/issues" target="_blank">Issue</a> or use the form on the <a href="submit">Submit page</a> and a member of our staff will turn your build into a JSON file.
        However, this may take several days or longer, especially if they have to ask you to submit additional information or correct mistakes.
