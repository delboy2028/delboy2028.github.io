    general: 
        - "Today Iâ€™m bringing you my D3-FNC or Defense build for group PvP. With the rework it has received in patch 1.8 I believe it to be one of the strongest sets around adding incredible amount of survivability and control over fights to the whole squad through group wide buffs and crowd control. I cannot recommend it enough."
