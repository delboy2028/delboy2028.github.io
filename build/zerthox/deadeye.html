    general: 
        - "DeadEYE is probably one of the controversial gearsets in 1.6. Some love it, some hate it. Either way, everyone agrees that its one of the strongest sets in terms of damage in the game right now."
        - "Rolling Stability or Accuracy on the weapon mods does not really matter, feel free pick your preferred handling stat."
