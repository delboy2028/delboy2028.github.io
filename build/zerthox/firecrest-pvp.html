build: 
    general: 
        - "This build tries to use the synergy between the Firecrest gearset, the Distracted talent on the Urban MDR and Shortbow Championship Knee Pads. If you do not want to run with a seeker, you can pick up a fire turret or something else instead. Keep in mind that is more of an (experimental) niche build though."
        - "Rolling Stability or Accuracy on the weapon mods does not really matter, feel free pick your preferred handling stat."
