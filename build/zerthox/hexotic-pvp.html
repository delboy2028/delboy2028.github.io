build: 
    general: 
        - "This is a DPS build for PvP. I don't recommend using it outside of a group with a healer that can overheal you, because you are lacking sustain."
        - "It can be used with literally any weapon in the game, I suggest running with at least one Assault Rifle or SMG in PvP though."
        - "Rolling Stability or Accuracy on the weapon mods does not really matter, feel free pick your preferred handling stat. But the Optimal Range on the underbarrel is for SMGs more beneficial that Stability or Accuracy in my opinion."
        - "If you want to have a similiar build for PvE, I suggest checking out my <a href='/build/zerthox/hexotic-pve'>Hexotic PvE DPS</a> build."
