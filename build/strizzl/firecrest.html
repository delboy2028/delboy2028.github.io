        - "Hey guys, another build that I've been having a good time with. The criteria for my builds: fulfill a role, and have a set playstyle. The build needs to be well rounded enough to solo weekly HVTs and supply drops as well as stave off rogues (at least in a 1v1)."
        - "Here's my brief gameplay clip so you can get a sense of Play style."
