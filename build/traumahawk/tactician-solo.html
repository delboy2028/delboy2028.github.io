    general: 
        - "I would say the most important part of this build are the weapon talents. While some people swear by using a level 29 weapon to get some other talents, I do not think that is necessary. First off, on both weapons I use competent, and talented for their perks. One one I have predatory rolled in the free slot so I can regenerate my health with a skill skill. On the other weapons I use ferocious to get 10% more daamage out of my skills. I know the talent absolutely works with the turret and sticky bomb, not sure about the seekers. Thoughts?"
