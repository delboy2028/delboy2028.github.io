## Disclaimer
These icons & icon spritesheets are the original icons taken from the [*Tom Clancy's The Division*](http://thedivisiongame.com) game files.  
I do not own any of the rights, I just host them here on the Github repository to provide more control and better accessability.  
All credit goes to [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com) and their respective studios working on the game  
([Massive](http://www.massive.se), [Red Storm](http://redstorm.com), [Ubisoft Reflections](http://reflections.ubisoft.com) and [Ubisoft Annecy](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-US/studio/annecy.aspx)).  
They have done a great job creating these icons, that is the reason why I prefer to use the original icons.
